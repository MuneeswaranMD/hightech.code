                        <p>Loot boxes in games allow players to pay for a mystery prize, which is revealed after they’ve handed over their money. The unpredictable nature of the transaction has led some people to say loot boxes can contribute to problem gambling. Now, a study suggests that this may be true, as when loot boxes were removed from a game the amount of problem gambling dropped too.</p>

                        <p>
                            IT HAS been nearly six months since Twitter’s transformation from iconic social media platform into the eccentric personal project of tech billionaire Elon Musk. I abandoned my account last November, save for work announcements – I didn’t want to stick around and watch the place fall apart. Still, I craved a digital hangout where I could connect with friends and colleagues, test out my half-baked ideas and look at cute pictures of capybaras

                        <p>
                            In an office overlooking an old shipyard in Brooklyn, I am learning that I may have walked over some entangled quantum light on my way here.
Since the previous evening, researchers at Qunnect have been sending particles of light, or photons, through a 34-kilometre-long loop of optical fibre underneath New York.....

                        <p>
                            A soft robotic hand can pick up nearly a dozen objects and adjust the way it is holding them when they start to slip.

Many robotic arms are good at picking up objects, but in-the-moment adjustments when an object starts to slip can be challenging if many parts of the robot must be moved at once. Thomas Thuruthel at University College London and his colleagues have made a simple soft robotic hand that can prevent an object from slipping with only wrist motions.

                            A proposed digital watermark to prevent artificial intelligence (AI) models from altering real photographs can be thwarted simply by saving the image as a JPEG file, say researchers, suggesting that managing the rise of photorealistic deepfakes will be harder than initially thought.

                        <p>
                            ChatGPT-powered AIs given long-term memory capabilities and personal motivations could role-play characters in a simulated town more believably than human crowd workers.

                            “This idea of creating believable agents that actually exhibit this behaviour – that give the illusion of realism – was something that we as an academic field wanted and have been talking about for the last four decades,” says Joon Sung Park at Stanford University in California.

                        <p>
                            Filling a test tube with molecules made from folded DNA can work as a simple computer. The approach has been used to split two numbers into prime factors.

Conventional computers work by passing electricity through tiny on-off switches to perform simple calculations. However, the new computer relies on the way that differently shaped DNA molecules combine.
